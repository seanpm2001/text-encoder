# TextEncoder

An implementation of the [WHATWG Encoding Specification](https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org) in PHP.

> The UTF-8 encoding is the most appropriate encoding for interchange of Unicode, the universal coded character set.

We agree with this statement. The goal of this project is to detect the current encoding of a string or document. If it isn't UTF-8, make it easy to convert to UTF-8.
