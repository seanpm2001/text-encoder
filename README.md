# TextEncoder

An implementation of the [WHATWG Encoding Specification](https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org) in PHP.

> The UTF-8 encoding is the most appropriate encoding for interchange of Unicode, the universal coded character set.

We agree with this statement. The goal of this project is to detect the current encoding of a string or document. If it isn't UTF-8, make it easy to convert to UTF-8.

## Coding Standards

PSR-1/2/5/12/19 are a solid foundation, but are not an entire coding style by themselves. By leveraging tools such as [PHP CS Fixer](http://cs.sensiolabs.org) and [PHP CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer), we can automate a large part of our style requirements.

These can be applied automatically by running the linter:

```bash
make lint
```

The things that we cannot yet automate are documented here: <https://github.com/simplepie/simplepie-ng-coding-standards>

## Please Support or Sponsor Development

The SimplePie project is a labor of love. Development of the next-generation of SimplePie was started in June 2017 as because it's a project I love, and I believe our community would benefit from this tool.

If you use SimplePie — especially to make money — it would be swell if you could kick down a few bucks. As the project grows, and we start leveraging more services and architecture, it would be great if it didn't all need to come out of my pocket.

You can also sponsor the development of a particular feature. If there's a feature that you want to see implemented, and I believe it's the right fit for the SimplePie project, you can sponsor the development of the feature to get it prioritized.

Your contributions are greatly and sincerely appreciated. See the **Sponsor** button along the top of the page for more information.
