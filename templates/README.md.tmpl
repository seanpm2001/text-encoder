# TextEncoder

An implementation of the [WHATWG Encoding Specification](https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org) in PHP.

> The UTF-8 encoding is the most appropriate encoding for interchange of Unicode, the universal coded character set.

We agree with this statement. The goal of this project is to detect the current encoding of a string or document. If it isn't UTF-8, make it easy to convert to UTF-8.

### [UTS #22](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr22/tr22-8.html): Unicode Character Mapping Markup Language

From §1.4: _Charset Alias Matching_

> Names and aliases of charsets are often spelled with small variations. To recognize accidental but unambiguous misspellings and avoid adding each possible variation to a list of recognized names, it is customary to match names case-insensitively and to ignore some punctuation. For best results, names should be compared after applying the following transformations:
>
> 1. Delete all characters except a-z, A-Z, and 0-9.
> 1. Map uppercase A-Z to the corresponding lowercase a-z.
> 1. From left to right, delete each 0 that is not preceded by a digit.
>
> For example, the following names should match: "UTF-8", "utf8", "u.t.f-008", but not "utf-80" or "ut8".
>
> **Note:** These rules are in place because in practice implementations are faced with many gratuitous variations in the use and omission of punctuation. There are a small number of IANA names for different charsets that match under these rules, but they appear to be rarely used, obscure charsets: "iso-ir-9-1" and "iso-ir-9-2" match "iso-ir-91" and "iso-ir-92", respectively. (There are also names in the IANA charset registry that violate the registry's own name syntax rules.)
